# üéôÔ∏è Text-to-Speech Converter

A simple **text-to-speech (TTS) web app** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, powered by the **Web Speech API**.  
Type any text, choose a voice, and click "Listen" to hear it spoken aloud.

## üìú Limitations
- Voice options depend on your **device, browser, and installed system voices**.  
- On **desktop browsers** (Chrome, Edge, Firefox), you may see dozens of voices in multiple languages.  
- On **mobile browsers** (iOS Safari, Android Chrome), only a few voices are available, and they usually match your **system language**.  

For example:  
- If your phone language is set to **Turkish**, you may only see 3‚Äì4 Turkish voices.  
- Even if you type English text, those voices will pronounce it with a Turkish accent.  

‚úÖ To get more voices in different languages, you need to **install additional voices** at the OS level:  
- **Android**: Settings ‚Üí Language & Input ‚Üí Text-to-speech ‚Üí Install voice data.  
- **iOS**: Settings ‚Üí Accessibility ‚Üí Spoken Content ‚Üí Voices ‚Üí Download a new language.  

This is a **browser/system limitation**, not a bug in this project.
